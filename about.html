            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, This is MadByAd! It is my developer name which stands for Made By Aditya, Aditya Wahyu Santoso is my
                real name! I am a student who excels at programming and creative arts. The name MadByAd i choose because it
                is simple and sound russian and techy, in my opinion. The color black and white i choose because black
                represents the background of my code while white is my digital canvas or the result of it, pretty interesting
                philosophy right? I am an Indonesian programmer who mostly make games but i can also code website and as a
                student i like and love to be creative
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
            <p>
                I started programming in late 2019. In the beginning i wanted to become a roblox developer and started
                learning Roblox Game Development, i did not manage to make any successfull game though i learn a lot.
                Eventually i leveled up my skills and started other kinds of programming, like actual Game Development
                using the Godot Game Engine and Web development and design. Eventually i also learned Blender and Krita
                which allows me to create 3D and 2D art. This digital medium is what i find best to pour in my creative
                idea
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>My Portofolio</h2>
